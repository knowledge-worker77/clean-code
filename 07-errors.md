## Error handling

You don't know what sort of rubbish the  end-user would enter in the text box that says input your email in the contact form so we add validations and error handling so that only email addresses may be entered in that input box.

Error handling and clean code have a very clear relation, Error handling is important in developing modern day software due to many factors(Slow network, old devices, etc..) but it shouldn't be the dominant force in your code base and obscure your logic.

Back in the distant past there were many languages that didnâ€™t have exceptions. In those languages the techniques for handling and reporting errors were limited. You either set an error flag or returned an error code that the caller could check.

Using `try-catch-finally`  statements in your code is a great way of catching errors. In a way, `try` blocks are like transactions. Your `catch` has to leave your program in a consistent state, no matter what happens in the try. For this reason it is good practice to start with a `try-catch-finally`statement when you are writing code that could throw exceptions.

## Catching bugs in errors

If you don't use a try-catch block in your code and happen to run into an error the error won't be displayed and the program will just stop running, leaving the user in a bad mood and you puzzled as to what could have gone wrong.

Create informative error messages and pass them along with your exceptions. Mention the operation that failed and the type of failure. If you are logging in your application, pass along enough information to be able to log the error in your catch.
