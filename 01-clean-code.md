## The cost of writing bad code

When you write code that "*Just works"* or you've come across code that was written by another developer which was a huge mess then you've probably spent quite some time fixing that poorly written code when you need it in the future.

The time that you spent fixing that code could've been used for other things. This is the importance of writing clean and manageable code.

Code that isn't written clearly and is just a jumble of messy variables and functions becomes a problem when you need to scale or use it again in a different environment. It will slow down the development process and will make the management angry.

If the bad code process continues then there will be a point in time where the mess will be too big to handle and then you'll have to start from scratch while also maintaining the legacy code.

## Writing clean code

Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of “cleanliness.” This “code-sense” is the key.

Some of us are born with it. Some of us have to fight to acquire it. Not only does it let us see whether code is good or bad, but it also shows us the strategy for applying our discipline to transform bad code into clean code. A programmer without “code-sense” can look at a messy module and recognize the mess but will have no idea what to do about it.

A programmer with “code-sense” will look at a messy module and see options and variations. The “code-sense” will help that programmer choose the best variation and guide him or her to plot a sequence of behavior preserving transformations to get from here to there. Bad code tries to do too much, it has muddled intent and ambiguity of purpose.

Clean code is focused. Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely un-distracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.

When you’ll read clean code you won’t be surprised at all. Just glancing at it will tell you a lot about the function that it performs. it will be pretty much what you expected. It will be obvious, simple, and compelling.

Each module will set the stage for the next. Each tells you how the next will be written. Some people will say that today’s programming languages weren’t made for the apps that we make and the bad code that they write is the reason that the language was not made to write clean code. A true developer knows that programming language’s power equals the programmers expertise in the language.

A newbie can even make hello world program look bad while an artisan will make a whole enterprise level application a work of art. Writing clean code is enough. The code must be kept clean over time so that it doesn’t rot and turn into bad code. There is saying of the boy scouts that applies to this:

> Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
