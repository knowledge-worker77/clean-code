## Naming variables

Choosing good variable names is a crucial part of writing clean code. A variable name should explain what that variable was created for.

The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If you don't name your variables correctly you'll end up creating problems for yourself.

Avoid using *noise* words when naming variables, names like`ProductInfo` and `ProductData` mean the same thing and if used for different things they lose their purpose. Same as noise words the word *variable* itself should not be a part of a name.

Your variable names should be pronounceable, if you have an error in your code and you want help then easily pronounceable words are better than gibberish.
