## Classes and Objects

Classes and objects should have noun or noun phrase in them. Avoid words like Manager, Processor, Data, or Info in the name of a class. A class name should not be a verb.

Methods should have verb or verb phrase names like `postPayment` , `deletePage`, or `saveAccessors`.

Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So use computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.

## Write less code

If you wanna write great functions in your code then you should follow these two rules:

- Your functions should be small.
- Each function should perform only one task.

These rules imply that the code blocks within your *if-else*, and *while* statements should be less than three lines long. Not only does this keep the enclosing function small, but it also adds documentary value because the function called within the block can have a nicely descriptive name.

Your code should have a top-down narrative. You should want all of your functions  to be followed by those at the next level of abstraction so that we can read the program easily.

## Cleaner switch statements

Making switch statements is much harder than functions because they always perform N number of things. If you really want to make them smaller your use them in low-level classes using poly-morphism.

Choosing descriptive names will clarify the design of the module in your mind and help you to improve it. Try to be consistent in your naming conventions and this will make things much simpler.
