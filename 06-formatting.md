## Code formatting

Code formatting is *Important,*  Good formatted code is easier to read and helps the code base remain consistent throughout. If you're working with a team then the whole team should decide on formatting rules so the whole code base looks consistent across the board.

Good formatted code is a sign of  a good programmer, these days every modern IDE or code editor has a code formatter built-into it or there are extensions available for it.

Formatted code not only looks nice and shows your expertise over the language but is also very helpful when you want to scale your project or refactor some block of code.

## Read it like a newspaper

A well formatted source code file should be written like a newspaper, The first few lines should summarize the whole file and as you keep reading along the whole details should present themselves from top to bottom.

Nearly all code is read left to right and top to bottom. Each line represents an expression or a clause, and each group of lines represents a complete thought. Those thoughts should be separated from each other with blank lines.

If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible. This gives the program a natural flow. If the convention is followed reliably, readers will be able to trust that function definitions will follow shortly after their use
