## Meaningful comments

When writing code always make sure to add well-placed and meaningful comments that describe what that piece of codes does. This is a great favor that you can do for your future self and the other developers that are going to read your code.

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express our self in code. So when you find yourself in a position where you need to write a comment, think it through and see whether there isnâ€™t some way to turn the tables and express yourself in code. Every time you express yourself in code, you should pat yourself on the back.

Good programmers should be disciplined enough to keep their comments as well as their code well maintained but the time and energy required to just maintaining comments could also be used on better things than comments.

Good documentation and meaningful comments don't make up for the bad code that you've written, Since bad code is a motivator for comments. Rather than writing comments about how much fuc**d up your code is spend that time and energy into cleaning up that mess of a code.

## Comments are necessary

Sometimes you must write comments in your code for explanation purposes and sometimes for legal purposes. You'll need to define copyright and authorship statements that are necessary and reasonable things to put into a comment at the start of each source file.

Comments can also act as warnings and warn people not to remove any core components from the code that can break things. Nowadays where people work in remote teams a new type comments have also emerged known as *TODO* comments. Todo comments simply tell your future self what things you need to complete in the code base to get the app into production,

Most programmers comment out deprecated code or code that has bugs in it and other developers won't remove it thinking that it's there for a reason and it ends up there for eternity.
